We write the code together.
Taks 1: We revised hashchain.cc by replacing the TODOs in the define section based on the description in hashchain.h.
Task 2: We implement functions in Lock based on lecture slides and logic in class Semaphore functions P() and V().
Task 3: We implement functions in Condition based on the description in the hearder file and the logic in part 1a's RWlock file.
The logic we use to replace the code in hashchain.cc is similar to the logic in part 1a's hashchain.cc.
